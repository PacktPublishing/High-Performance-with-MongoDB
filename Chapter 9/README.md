# Chapter 9: Transactions

## Introduction

This chapter explores MongoDB's multi-document ACID transactionsâ€”a feature that greatly expanded MongoDB's capabilities for mission-critical workloads. You'll learn when and how to use transactions, understand their performance implications, and discover best practices for maintaining data integrity without sacrificing performance.

## Key Topics Covered

- Multi-document ACID transactions
- History and evolution of transactions in MongoDB
- ACID properties in MongoDB
- Document-level atomicity vs. multi-document transactions
- When to use multi-document transactions
- Transactions API and session management (Core and Callback APIs)
- Read/write concerns and transaction behavior
- Performance considerations
- Managing transaction runtime limits and errors
- Lock acquisition and contention management
- Common anti-patterns and their costs

## Code Snippets

Below are the code snippets available for this chapter. These examples illustrate key concepts and patterns discussed in the text.

- [document_level_atomicity_example.json](./document_level_atomicity_example.json): Example of using document-level atomicity for single-document operations.
- [multi_document_transaction_core_api.js](./multi_document_transaction_core_api.js): Example of a multi-document transaction using the Core API.
- [core_api_transaction_pattern.js](core_api_transaction_pattern.js): Example of using the Core API for transaction management.
- [callback_api_transaction_pattern.js](./callback_api_transaction_pattern.js): Example of using the Callback API for transaction management.
- [transaction_read_write_concern_example.js](transaction_read_write_concern_example.js): Shows proper transaction read/write concern configuration.
- [data_modeling_tip_user_document.js](data_modeling_tip_user_document.js): Demonstrates data modeling to avoid unnecessary transactions.

## How to Use the Code Snippets

- **Purpose**: The snippets are designed to illustrate transaction patterns, configuration, and data modeling strategies. They are not full applications, but focused examples.
- **Usage**: Read each snippet alongside the relevant section in the chapter. You can copy and adapt the code for your own MongoDB projects.
- **Not Directly Runnable**: Most snippets are partial examples and may require additional setup (e.g., MongoDB connection, collection definitions) to run.
- **Interpretation**: Focus on the transaction logic, session management, and configuration options shown in each example.

## Best Practices

- Prefer single-document atomicity when possible for better performance.
- Use multi-document transactions only when necessary for data integrity.
- Always handle errors and abort transactions when needed.
- Set appropriate read and write concerns for durability and consistency.
- Avoid anti-patterns such as large-scale writes in a single transaction.
- Design schemas to minimize the need for transactions.
