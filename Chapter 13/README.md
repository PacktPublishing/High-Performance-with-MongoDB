# Chapter 13: Operating Systems and System Resources

## Introduction

This chapter focuses on optimizing MongoDB performance by tuning operating system and system resources, with an emphasis on self-managed deployments. You will learn how infrastructure choices, OS and storage configuration, and resource monitoring impact reliability and throughput. While MongoDB Atlas automates many aspects, understanding these principles is essential for diagnosing and resolving bottlenecks in any environment.

## Key Topics Covered

- Impact of infrastructure and OS choices on MongoDB performance
- CPU utilization and core-to-operation ratios
- Memory management and WiredTiger cache configuration
- Storage device types, file system selection (XFS vs ext4), and cache settings
- Network bottlenecks, topology, and OS-level tuning
- Monitoring and troubleshooting resource usage
- Atlas auto-scaling and workload isolation features

## Code Snippet Files

Below are the code snippets and configuration examples referenced in this chapter. These are sorted in the order they appear:

- [top_cpu_usage.sh](./top_cpu_usage.sh) – Shell script to monitor CPU usage and identify high CPU processes
- [fstab_noatime_examples.sh](./fstab_noatime_examples.sh) – Shell script to demonstrate disabling atime updates for performance
- [monitor_dirty_memory.sh](./monitor_dirty_memory.sh) – Shell script to monitor dirty memory and page cache usage
- [dtstat_top_io.sh](./dstat_top_io.sh) – Shell script to monitor top I/O processes and diagnose write stalls
- [set_dirty_background_ratio.sh](./set_dirty_background_ratio.sh) – Shell script to adjust dirty background ratio for better write performance
- [set_dirty_ratio.sh](./set_dirty_ratio.sh) – Shell script to dial down dirty ration and reduce blocking risk.
  
## How to Read and Use the Code Snippets

- **Shell scripts**: Run these in a Linux environment to monitor system resources or diagnose performance issues. Ensure you have the necessary privileges and are working in a test or development environment.
- **Configuration examples**: Use these as references for tuning OS and MongoDB settings. Adapt values to your hardware and workload.
- **Purpose**: Most snippets are illustrative and may require modification for your environment. They are not full applications, but focused examples to help you understand and apply the concepts discussed in the chapter.

## Best Practices for Using the Code Snippets

- Always test configuration changes in a staging environment before applying to production.
- Monitor resource usage regularly and adjust settings based on observed bottlenecks.
- Use dedicated hardware for MongoDB when possible; avoid running other CPU- or I/O-intensive workloads on the same server.
- Prefer XFS or ext4 file systems for MongoDB data and journal files.
- Keep resident memory usage below 80% to avoid paging and OOM errors.
- Monitor SSD health and enable TRIM/garbage collection.
- Use Atlas auto-scaling and workload isolation features for managed deployments.
