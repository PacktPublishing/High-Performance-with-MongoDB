# Chapter 15: Debugging Performance Issues

## Introduction

Performance issues in MongoDB can be challenging and disruptive, often surfacing unexpectedly and impacting application reliability. This chapter provides a structured approach to identifying, diagnosing, and resolving performance problems, building on techniques covered in earlier chapters. Through real-world case studies, you will learn how to recognize symptoms, trace root causes, and implement targeted solutions to restore and maintain high performance.

## Key Topics Covered

- The three fundamental causes of slow MongoDB performance
- Identifying inherently slow operations (collection scans, large aggregations, inefficient queries)
- Diagnosing blocked operations and resource contention
- Using MongoDB Atlas and monitoring tools for root cause analysis
- Implementing solutions: indexing, query optimization, alerting, and resource management
- Preventing future issues with proactive monitoring and best practices

## Code Snippet Files

Below are the code and command snippets provided for this chapter. These examples illustrate how to diagnose, monitor, and resolve performance issues in MongoDB. Snippets are sorted in the order they appear in the chapter:

- [`find_long_running_ops.js`](./find_long_running_ops.js): Identifies operations running longer than a specified threshold using `db.currentOp`.
- [`kill_long_running_op.js`](./kill_long_running_op.js): Terminates a problematic operation using `db.killOp`.
- [`index_recommendation_output.json`](./index_recommendation_output.json): Sample output from Atlas Performance Advisor showing recommended indexes.
- [`slow_query_profiler_output.json`](./slow_query_profiler_output.json): Example profiler output for slow queries and collection scans.
- [`cursor_leak_log_analysis.sh`](./cursor_leak_log_analysis.sh): Shell script to analyze log files for cursor leaks and open cursor counts.
- [`open_cursor_count_profiler.js`](./open_cursor_count_profiler.js): Script to monitor open cursor counts using the profiler and serverStatus.
- [`list_sharded_unsharded_collections.js`](./list_sharded_unsharded_collections.js): Lists sharded and unsharded collections in a MongoDB cluster.

## How to Read and Use the Code Snippets

- **MongoDB Shell Scripts (`.js`)**: Run these scripts in the MongoDB shell (`mongosh`) connected to your test or development environment. They illustrate how to identify long-running operations, kill problematic queries, and monitor open cursors. Adapt them to your own collections and operational needs.
- **Shell Scripts (`.sh`)**: Use these scripts in your system terminal to analyze MongoDB log files for patterns such as cursor leaks. Ensure you have the necessary privileges and log access.
- **Profiler and Advisor Output (`.json`)**: Review these samples to understand the format and interpretation of profiler and index recommendation results. Use them to compare with your own profiler output and identify slow operations or missing indexes.
- **Interpretation**: Most snippets are illustrative and may require modification for your environment. They are not full applications, but focused examples to help you understand and apply the concepts discussed in the chapter.

## Best Practices for Using the Code Snippets

- Always test diagnostic and remediation scripts in a staging environment before applying to production.
- Use the profiler and logs to correlate slow queries with resource usage and system metrics.
- Implement recommended indexes carefully, monitoring system impact during creation and after deployment.
- Set up alerts for key metrics (e.g., query targeting ratio, open cursor count) to detect issues early.
- Regularly review and optimize queries, indexes, and resource allocation as your workload evolves.
- Document your troubleshooting steps and solutions for future reference.
