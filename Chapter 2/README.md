# Chapter 2: MongoDB Schema Design & Patterns

This folder contains code snippets, configuration examples, and reference material for Chapter 2 of "High Performance with MongoDB." The chapter focuses on schema design principles, common pitfalls, and practical patterns for optimizing MongoDB data models.

## Key Topics

- **Schema Design Fundamentals**: Embedding vs. referencing, dynamic attributes, schema evolution
- **Performance Optimization**: Read/write efficiency, caching, snapshots, denormalization
- **Schema Validation**: Enforcing data integrity, business rules, and maintainable schemas
- **Common Mistakes**: Overnormalization, overembedding, anti-patterns, poor indexing strategy
- **Design Patterns**: Embedded pattern, extended reference pattern, subset pattern

## How to Use the Code Snippets

This folder contains a collection of MongoDB code snippets and configuration examples for Chapter 2. These files support learning and reference for schema design, validation, and optimization patterns.

### How to Read These Files

- **File Types:**
  - `.bson` files: Document structure and schema examples

- **Non-Runnable Snippets:**
  - Some files (especially those with placeholder syntax, ellipses (`...`), or incomplete code) are for illustration only. They demonstrate concepts, configuration, or output structure. Use these as templates or references when designing your own schemas or tool configurations.

## Best Practices

- Review code before running in a production environment.
- Use these examples as learning aids or starting points for your own MongoDB projects.
- Refer to the chapter or official documentation for context on each snippet.
