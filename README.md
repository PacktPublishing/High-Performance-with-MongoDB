With data as the new competitive edge, performance has become the need of the hour. As applications handle exponentially growing data and user demand for speed and reliability rises, three industry experts distill their decades of experience to offer you guidance on designing, building, and operating databases that deliver fast, scalable, and resilient experiences.
MongoDB’s document model and distributed architecture provide powerful tools for modern applications, but unlocking their full potential requires a deep understanding of architecture, operational patterns, and tuning best practices. This MongoDB book takes a hands-on approach to diagnosing common performance issues and applying proven optimization strategies from schema design and indexing to storage engine tuning and resource management.
Whether you’re optimizing a single replica set or scaling a sharded cluster, this book provides the tools to maximize deployment performance. Its modular chapters let you explore query optimization, connection management, and monitoring or follow a complete learning path to build a rock-solid performance foundation. With real-world case studies, code examples, and proven best practices, you’ll be ready to troubleshoot bottlenecks, scale efficiently, and keep MongoDB running at peak performance in even the most demanding production environments.</details>

  <summary><h2>Get to know Authors</h2></summary>

_Asya Kamsky_ Asya Kamsky is a Principal KnowItAll at MongoDB, where she has worked since 2012. Before discovering MongoDB, she spent nearly two decades coaxing relational databases into doing what they were never designed to do at a series of startups, most of which no one remembers. Asya has an extensive background in software development, databases, and telling people what they're doing wrong.

_Ger Hartnett_ Ger Hartnett is a Lead Engineer on MongoDB's product performance team, where he loves working on fascinating optimization and scaling challenges. Before MongoDB, he founded a startup that built a project communication platform (that had scaling issues). Prior to that, he architected and tuned embedded software at Intel, where he co-authored a book. Even before that, he developed systems at companies including Tellabs, Digital, and Motorola.

_Alex Bevilacqua_ Alex Bevilacqua is the Lead Product Manager at MongoDB for Developer Experience. Prior to joining MongoDB in 2018, he worked as a software engineer and systems architect, implementing solutions in a number of languages, technologies, and frameworks. Aside from his passion for programming that consumes more than just his working hours, Alex can typically be found at an arena with one of his kids, both of whom play rep hockey.
