# Chapter 4: Aggregations

## Introduction

This chapter explores MongoDB's aggregation framework—a powerful system for transforming, summarizing, and analyzing data. You'll learn how to build efficient aggregation pipelines, optimize performance, and handle large datasets, with a focus on best practices for high-performance data processing.

## Key Topics Covered

- Fundamentals of MongoDB’s aggregation framework
- Optimization techniques for aggregation pipeline performance
- Best practices for working with large datasets
- Aggregation in distributed environments and sharded collections
- Monitoring, profiling, and troubleshooting aggregation performance

## Code and Snippet Files (in order of appearance)

- [aggregation-pipeline-example-1.sh](./aggregation-pipeline-example-1.sh)
- [aggregation-pipeline-example-2.sh](./aggregation-pipeline-example-2.sh)
- [aggregation-explain-example-1.js](./aggregation-explain-example-1.js)
- [aggregation-explain-output-1.sh](./aggregation-explain-output-1.sh)
- [aggregation-explain-example-2.js](./aggregation-explain-example-2.js)
- [aggregation-explain-output-2.sh](./aggregation-explain-output-2.sh)
- [aggregation-lookup-example.js](./aggregation-lookup-example.js)
- [aggregation-lookup-output.sh](./aggregation-lookup-output.sh)

## How to Use the Code Snippets

- **Shell scripts**: Illustrate aggregation concepts using Unix-style pipelines and example output. These are for demonstration and are not directly related to MongoDB shell, but help visualize pipeline processing and explain output.
- **Python scripts**: Show how to connect to MongoDB, insert documents, and perform queries using PyMongo. You can run these with Python (3.7+) and the `pymongo` package installed.
- **.js scripts**: These JavaScript files are intended to be run in the MongoDB shell.

> **Note:** Some code snippets are illustrative and may not be runnable as-is. Review comments and adapt them to your environment as needed.

## Best Practices

- Place `$match` and `$sort` stages early in your pipeline to leverage indexes and reduce data volume.
- Avoid unnecessary `$project` stages at the start; use them at the end to reshape results.
- Use array expressions like `$map`, `$filter`, and `$reduce` for efficient array processing.
- Monitor memory usage and be aware of aggregation limits (e.g., 16 MB document size, 100 MB per stage).
- Use `explain()` to profile and optimize your aggregation pipelines.
