# Chapter 8: Change Streams

## Introduction

This chapter explores MongoDBâ€™s change streams, a powerful feature for building reactive, event-driven applications. Change streams allow you to receive real-time notifications of updates as they occur within collections, databases, or across your entire deployment. The chapter covers the architecture, implementation strategies, and performance considerations for using change streams effectively in high-performance MongoDB environments.

## Key Topics Covered

- Understanding the architecture of change streams and how they work
- Efficient use of change streams: scope selection and server-side filtering
- Managing performance and durability in change stream consumers
- Advanced patterns for production readiness, including sharded clusters and document size constraints

## Code Snippets

Below are the code snippets available for this chapter. These illustrate key concepts and operations discussed in the text:

- [change_stream_event_example.bson](./change_stream_event_example.bson): An example change stream event for a change to the price field in a document in a products collection.
- [change_stream_filter_example.js](./change_stream_filter_example.js): Example of using server-side filtering to reduce event volume and network overhead.
- [price_monitor_service.js](./price_monitor_service.js): Example service for monitoring product price changes using change streams, server-side filtering, and document lookup strategies
- [sharded_stream_options.js](./sharded_stream_options.js): Example of configuring change streams in a sharded cluster, including options for batchSize and maxAwaitTimeMS.

## How to Use the Code Snippets

- These snippets are intended for educational purposes and illustrate how to implement and optimize change streams in MongoDB.
- They are not standalone applications; use them as references when building your own event-driven or monitoring services.
- Before running the code, ensure you have the necessary privileges and are working in a test or development environment.
- Adapt the examples to your own collection names, business logic, and performance requirements as needed.

## Best Practices

- Choose the narrowest change stream scope that meets your requirements to minimize resource usage and event volume
- Use server-side filtering with aggregation pipelines to reduce network and client processing overhead
- Monitor oplog size and change stream lag to avoid missing events during downtime or high load
- Batch event processing and dedicate resources for high-volume streams
- Test and tune parameters such as batchSize and maxAwaitTimeMS for sharded clusters
