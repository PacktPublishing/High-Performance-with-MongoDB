# Chapter 1: Introduction to MongoDB

This folder contains code snippets, configuration examples, and reference material for Chapter 1 of "High Performance with MongoDB." The chapter introduces MongoDB, its document model, and foundational concepts for developers and administrators.

## Key Topics

- **MongoDB Overview**: NoSQL document database, JSON-like data model, flexible schema
- **Core Concepts**: Collections, documents, indexes, CRUD operations
- **Performance Features**: Aggregation, sharding, replication, encryption, scaling
- **Developer Tools**: Shell, drivers, Atlas, Compass
- **Use Cases**: Real-world applications, industry adoption

## Snippet Files (in order of appearance)

Below is a sorted, linked list of code and configuration snippet files referenced or included in this chapter:

### Python Scripts

- [`document_model_example.py`](./document_model_example.py) — Example of MongoDB document modeling in Python
- [`pymongo_connect_insert_example.py`](./pymongo_connect_insert_example.py) — Connecting to MongoDB and inserting documents
- [`pymongo_nested_insert_query_example.py`](./pymongo_nested_insert_query_example.py) — Nested document insert and query

Other illustrative code blocks and configuration examples are included in the chapter text.

Refer to each file for the corresponding code or configuration snippet as described in the chapter. For further details, consult the official MongoDB documentation linked below.

## How to Use the Code Snippets

This folder contains a collection of MongoDB code snippets and configuration examples for Chapter 1. These files support learning and reference for basic MongoDB concepts, document structure, and introductory queries.

### How to Read These Files

- **File Types:**
  - `.py` files: Python scripts for document modeling and database operations

- **Non-Runnable Snippets:**
  - Some files (especially those with placeholder syntax, ellipses (`...`), or incomplete code) are for illustration only. They demonstrate concepts, configuration, or output structure. Use these as templates or references when designing your own queries or tool configurations.

- **Runnable Code:**
  - Most `.py` are complete examples and can be run as-is in a suitable test environment. Some scripts assume the existence of certain resources—review and adapt as needed for your setup.

## Best Practices

- Review code before running in a production environment.
- Use these examples as learning aids or starting points for your own MongoDB projects.
- Refer to the chapter or official documentation for context on each snippet.
