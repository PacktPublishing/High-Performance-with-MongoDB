# Chapter 5: Replication

## Introduction

This chapter explores MongoDB's replication mechanisms, focusing on how replica sets, read preference, and write concern deliver high availability, data durability, and flexible workload management. You'll learn about the architecture of replica sets, configuration options, and best practices for optimizing performance and reliability in distributed environments.

## Key Topics Covered

- Understanding MongoDB replica sets
- Components of a replica set (primary, secondaries, arbiters)
- Election process and node configuration
- Read preference and write concern
- Performance and availability considerations
- Advanced replica set configurations (chained replication, analytics nodes, tags)
- Flow control and replication lag management
- The operations log (oplog) and its sizing
- Best practices for monitoring and tuning replication

## Code Snippet Files

The following code snippets are provided to illustrate key concepts and configuration steps discussed in the chapter. They are intended for educational purposes and should be run in a test environment or MongoDB shell, not directly in production.

Sorted in order of appearance in the chapter:

1. [chained_replication_config.js](./chained_replication_config.js) – Example configuration for chained replication in a replica set.
2. [monitor_sync_source.js](./monitor_sync_source.js) – Script to check the sync source for a secondary node in a replica set.
3. [replica_set_tag_config.js](./replica_set_tag_config.js) – Configuration example for setting up tags on replica set members to isolate workloads.
4. [analytics_node_read_pref.js](./analytics_node_read_pref.js) – Example of using read preference to target analytics nodes in a replica set.
5. [atlas_connection_string.txt](./atlas_connection_string.txt) – Sample MongoDB Atlas connection string for targeting analytics nodes.
6. [flow_control_settings.js](./flow_control_settings.js) – Example of configuring flow control settings in a replica set.
7. [check_oplog_size.js](./check_oplog_size.js) – Command to check the oplog size and ensure it meets the replication window requirements.
8. [oplog_resize_size.js](./oplog_resize_size.js) – Script to resize the oplog for a replica set to accommodate larger write volumes.
9. [oplog_resize_retention.js](./oplog_resize_retention.js) – Example of adjusting oplog retention settings based on write volume and expected outage duration.
10. [write_concern_example.js](./write_concern_example.js) – Example of setting write concern for durability in a replica set.

## Instructions for Using the Code Snippets

- **JavaScript files (`.js`)**: These are intended to be run in the MongoDB shell (`mongosh`). Copy and paste the code into your shell connected to a test replica set.
- **Text files (`.txt`)**: These provide example connection strings or configuration values. Adapt them for your environment as needed.
- **Monitoring scripts**: Use these to observe replica set status and replication metrics. Always validate in a non-production environment first.

## Interpreting the Snippets

Most snippets are not standalone applications but configuration or monitoring commands. They illustrate how to:

- Set write concern for durability
- Configure replica set tags for workload isolation
- Target analytics nodes for reporting queries
- Monitor replication status and oplog window

## Best Practices

- Always test configuration changes in a staging environment before applying to production.
- Monitor replication lag and oplog window regularly to ensure secondaries can keep up.
- Use tags and read preferences to isolate workloads and optimize performance.
- Size your oplog to accommodate your write volume and expected outage duration.
- Avoid using arbiters in production unless absolutely necessary.
